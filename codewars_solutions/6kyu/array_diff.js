// Description:
/* Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3] */

// Solution:
function arrayDiff(a, b) {
  
    if (a.length === 0 || b.length === 0) {
      return a
    } else {
      return a.filter((item) => {
        return !b.includes(item);
        }); 
    }
    
  }

// Sample tests:
/* describe("Basic tests", () => {
  it("Should pass Basic tests", () => {
    assert.deepEqual(arrayDiff([1,2], [1]), [2], "a was [1,2], b was [1]");
    assert.deepEqual(arrayDiff([1,2,2], [1]), [2,2], "a was [1,2,2], b was [1]");
    assert.deepEqual(arrayDiff([1,2,2], [2]), [1], "a was [1,2,2], b was [2]");
    assert.deepEqual(arrayDiff([1,2,2], []), [1,2,2], "a was [1,2,2], b was []");
    assert.deepEqual(arrayDiff([], [1,2]), [], "a was [], b was [1,2]");
    assert.deepEqual(arrayDiff([1,2,3], [1,2]), [3], "a was [1,2,3], b was [1,2]")
  });
}); */
