# Codewars

Though not my favourite thing, I'm aware of the value of stretching my problem solving muscles and also getting to grips with basics and methods by using them more - hence aiming to practice more on Codewars.

I'll be keeping a log of my solutions here for my own ease of access as well as to show activity if I haven't been pushing to project repos.

May the odds be ever in my favour - unless the kata is to make everything even, I guess...
